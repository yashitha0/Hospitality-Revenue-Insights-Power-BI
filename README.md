# Business Problem

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making within management, AtliQ Grands is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. They currently lack an in-house data analytics team to provide insights for informed decision-making.

Our task is to create a dashboard with key performance metrics and provide relevant insights to the revenue team, based on their historical data.
